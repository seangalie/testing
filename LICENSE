This Is Not A License....

Congratulations — you've found the placeholder "LICENSE" file. Before you get
excited: this was not supposed to be a license of any kind, and definitely not
any type of legal instrument. It is meant to entertain, amuse, and possibly
confuse anyone who reads it within this repository.  However, if you feel the
need to use my placeholder for your own workflow, here's the MIT license:
